    "The \"Martingale Betting System\" is a specific strategy where, when applied to the game of Roulette, involves the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will initially start by betting a small amount (ex: $1) on red,\n",
    "- If you win (the wheel lands on red), you will win your bet, and then bet $1 again on red,\n",
    "- Each time red lose, you double your bet.  (Initially, it'll be a $2 bet, then $4, then $8, and so on.)\n",
    "- Each will will always recover all previous losses.  (A $4 bet that wins happens after a $1 and $2 loss, resulting in a +$1 win.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly claimed that this strategy will result in an **infinite increasing amount of money** so long as you play the game long enough!  In this MicroProject, we will explore this claim and use simulation to play Roulette using the Martingale Betting System.  Let's nerd out! :)"

In the game of Roulette, a large wheel with 38 slots is spun and a ball is placed into the spinning wheel.  As the spinning wheel slows down, the ball will land in one of the 38 slots.  Each of the slots are labeled with a number **and** a color.\n",
